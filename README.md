# Evoliz PHP bindings

[//]: # (@Todo : Put some badges : https://poser.pugx.org/)

The Evoliz PHP library provides convenient access to the Evoliz API from
applications written in the PHP language. It includes a pre-defined set of
classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API
responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the Evoliz
API.

## Requirements

PHP 7.0.0 and later.

## Composer

You can install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command:

```bash
composer require evoliz/evoliz-php
```
